Egypt Economic Growth

Growth should accelerate in FY 2018. Investment will likely rise sharply, boosted by stronger business sentiment and an improved regulatory environment, while the external sector will benefit from the weaker pound. However, the elevated debt burden could become a pressing concern if reform momentum ebbs. FocusEconomics analysts expect GDP to expand 4.5% in FY 2018, up 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 4.9% in FY 2019.
